Commit Syntax Checker
------------------------

This tool helps to check the syntax of the commit title and the commit description.
By following the guidelines provided by the checker, the commit is easier to
understand and becomes more readable.

Here are the rules constructed by the syntax checker script:

1. The length of commit title must be maximum 55 characters long.
   If the commit is a revert commit, then the maximum length is
   adjusted accordingly.

2. The commit title must contain at least 3 words separated by space.
   The commit tag is included in these 3 words.
   For instance: 'ci: Fix everything' is a valid commit title.

3. The commit title must not end with punctoation marks.
   This includes: (.?!)

4. The second line of the commit message must be an empty line.

5. The length of commit description lines must be
   maximum 65 characters long each.

If you wish to test the script manually:
- The check_message_syntax.py script has 2 parameters:
  --message (REQUIRED) (string - base64 encoded format)
  --debug (OPTIONAL)

  The message parameter must be in base64 encoded format because the script
  was created to work with Gerrit and Jenkins.

- example usage:
'''test: This is a test title

This is a test description'''

  The commit message above in base64 encoded format:
  dGVzdDogVGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdGl0bGUKClRoaXMgaXMgYSB0ZXN0IGRlc2NyaXB0aW9uCg==

  ./check_message_syntax --message 'dGVzdDogVGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdGl0bGUKClRoaXMgaXMgYSB0ZXN0IGRlc2NyaXB0aW9uCg'

  If you wish you can turn on the debugger mode, in which case:
  ./check_message_syntax --message 'dGVzdDogVGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdGl0bGUKClRoaXMgaXMgYSB0ZXN0IGRlc2NyaXB0aW9uCg'
  --debug

The commit syntax checker has its own unittests which you can run (requires pytest module):
python3 -m pytest -v

The script uses Python3. (was created with 3.5.2 version)
